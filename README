OpenEmbedded/Yocto BSP layer for Toradex Easy Installer
-------------------------------------------------------

This layer is used to build the Toradex Easy Installer utility.
It provides a small distro called `tezi` along with image recipes
for the root file system and recipes for the Qt based UI.

Currently the Qt User Interface as well as the utility flash-wince
are not publicly available and stored on internal only git
repositories. In order to build an image one needs to remove those
two utilities from the image recipe:


    CORE_IMAGE_BASE_INSTALL:remove = "qt-tezi qt-tezictl"


As well as rename the recipes from recipes-tezi directory to avoid
bitbake parsing/fetching:

    mv recipes-tezi/flash-wince/flash-wince_0.2.bb recipes-tezi/flash-wince/flash-wince_0.2.bb.INTERNAL
    mv recipes-tezi/qt-tezi/qt-tezi_git.bb recipes-tezi/qt-tezi/qt-tezi_git.bb.INTERNAL
    mv recipes-tezi/qt-tezi/qt-tezictl_git.bb recipes-tezi/qt-tezi/qt-tezictl_git.bb.INTERNAL
